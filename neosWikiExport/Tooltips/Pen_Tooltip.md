Pen Tooltip is a [tooltip](Common_Tooltips "wikilink") based on the
Resonite' [Brush System](Brush_System "wikilink"), setup as a simple pen
(or highlighter) for writing down notes and text. You can find it in the
[Resonite Content Hub](Resonite_Content_Hub "wikilink"), along with a
few premade materials.
