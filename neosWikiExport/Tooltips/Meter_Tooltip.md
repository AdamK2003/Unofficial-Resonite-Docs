Measuring Tooltip is a [tooltip](Common_Tooltips "wikilink") that allows
you to measure physical distances in Resonite. It can measure distance
between two arbitrary points on the surface of any objects (including
the same object), distance to the nearest point in the direction
perpendicular to a point on the surface or between two arbitrary points
in 3D space.
