The Component Clone Tooltip is a [tooltip](Common_Tooltips "wikilink")
that allows you to copy a [component](component "wikilink") from one
[slot](slot "wikilink") to another. It can be found in Essential Tools
in your Inventory.

## Usage

Grab the title of a component with the tooltip, and then
[secondary-click](Basic_Controls "wikilink"). This stores the component
in the tooltip. Then, in an [inspector](Scene_Inspector "wikilink") open
with the slot you want to copy to,
[primary-click](Basic_Controls "wikilink") on the bar on the left. This
copies the component into that slot.

You can also primary-click on an object. This will copy the component to
the object's root (if it has one) or to the slot that was hit.
