The ButtonStringErase component can be used to remove characters from
the beginning or end of a string whenever a button is pressed.

## Fields

## Usage

To function, the component simply needs to be attached to a slot that
also has a button component attached to it. From then on, pressing that
button will activate the ButtonStringErade, making it erase the first or
last `Count` characters from its `TargetString`.
