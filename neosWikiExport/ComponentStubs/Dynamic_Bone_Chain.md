Dynamic Bone Chain is a component that allows you to add
[rigidbody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body) physics to the
bones of a rigged model or avatar. Bones with rigidbody physics are
called dynamic bones; this name is derived from a [Unity
asset](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/dynamic-bone-16743)
that offers similar functionality.

To add dynamic bones to a model, navigate through the model's armature
in the Inspector until you locate the bone you want to use as the "root"
or "master" bone. Then, attach the Dynamic Bone Chain component, and
click Setup From Children. This will add the root bone and all its
children to the dynamic bone chain.

The Dynamic Bone Chain component contains various properties for
adjusting the physical behavior of the bone chain. The most important
properties in the component are Inertia, InertiaForce, Damping,
Elasticity, and Stiffness. The descriptions of each are listed below:
