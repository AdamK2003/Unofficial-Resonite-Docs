The ButtonValueToggle component can be used to make a button that
switches a boolean value between true and false every time the button is
pressed.

## Fields

## Usage

To function, the component simply needs to be attached to a slot that
also has a button component attached to it. From then on, pressing that
button will activate the ButtonToggle, making it toggle its
`TargetValue` from true to false or the other way round.
