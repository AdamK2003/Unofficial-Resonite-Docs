## Miscellaneous Notes

When adding this Component to an object that has the
[Grabbable_(Component)](Grabbable_(Component) "wikilink"), you will
notice that the object may not be grabbable anymore. To remedy this,
create a child object on the main object you want to be your button.
Then, on that child object, attach this component. You should now have
an object that is grabbable and functions as a button.
