The ButtonStringAppend component can be used to add a string to the
beginning or end of a string whenever a button is pressed.

## Fields

## Usage

To function, the component simply needs to be attached to a slot that
also has a button component attached to it. From then on, pressing that
button will activate the ButtonStringAppend, making it append its
`AppendString` to its `TargetString`.
