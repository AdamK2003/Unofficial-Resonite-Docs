## Intoduction

The **VRIK** component is used to configure Inverse Kinematics on an
avatar, for posing joints based on the position of IK Targets such as a
[VR HMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-mounted_display), [hand
tracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_tracking), or [Vive
Trackers](https://www.vive.com/us/accessory/vive-tracker/)

This component is automatically configured when importing a mesh with a
detectable [humanoid
rig](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingHumanoidChars.html#Rigging),
and generally should not be modified unless you know what you are doing.

Documentation on this component may take some time, as it is very
complex, and not commonly used. The basis for this component seems to be
the VRIK solver developed by [Final
IK](http://www.root-motion.com/finalikdox/html/page16.html).

## Usage

All weight values are 1-0, excluding clamps which are inverted 0-1. As
usual for Resonite, you can overdrive some of them with interesting
results.
