<languages/> <translate> If when you try to join other User's sessions
you get an error message "Security Violation", then follow these steps
to try and resolve it.

1.  Try [synchronizing your clock](Synchronize_your_Clock "wikilink"),
    having an incorrect time can lead to this.
2.  Try Logging out of your Resonite account and then back in. This will
    reset your Resonite login information.

If these fail then please, post a **regular** [log
file](Log_Files "wikilink") in the #bugs-and-feedback channel of our
[Discord](https://discord.gg/Resonite).
