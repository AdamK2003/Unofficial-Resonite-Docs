<languages/> <translate> Sync Errors are a variety of issues that
prevent your copy of Resonite from synchronizing with the Resonite
Cloud. There are a variety of issues which are common, but we're writing
guides for each of the common variants which are listed below. There's
also some general guidance that will work for any variety of Sync Error.

# General Guidance

Here's some general guidance that works for any Sync Error:

1.  Ensure your main drive (Default C:), has enough free space. Resonite
    requires free drive space to sync, so ensure you have some free
    space.

If want to change directory, check [Command Line
Arguments](Command_Line_Arguments#.E3.83.87.E3.83.BC.E3.82.BF.E3.83.99.E3.83.BC.E3.82.B9 "wikilink")

# Specific Guides

We have multiple guides for Sync related matters, please ensure you are
reading the correct one for your problem:

-   [Stuck Sync](Stuck_Sync "wikilink") - A general guide for resolving
    your account syncing when it is **"Stuck"** and specifically not
