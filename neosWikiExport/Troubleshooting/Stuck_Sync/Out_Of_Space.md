<languages/><translate> If you've ended up here, then you're trying to
resolve a [Stuck Sync](Stuck_Sync "wikilink") that is caused by your
hard drive being full.

# Error Explanation

This is caused by an item/world that you are trying to save that is too
large for the rest of your storage space, and therefore it cannot be
stored.

This can occur, even if your storage indicator says you have storage
left.

Please follow [this guide](Full_Storage "wikilink") on what to do when
your storage is full.
