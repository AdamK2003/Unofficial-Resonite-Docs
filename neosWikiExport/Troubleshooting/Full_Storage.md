<languages/> <translate> If your account storage is full and you're not
sure why, this guide is for you.

# Things that affect storage

-   Items saved to your inventory
-   Items sent to Contacts
-   Voice messages sent to contacts
-   Worlds and their contents

# How storage is calculated?

Storage calculations are quite complicated as we try to de-duplicate
assets as much as possible. This means it is difficult to answer exactly
how much an individual item will take up.

A few good pointers are that:

-   If an item is unique to you, as in no one else has a copy of it.
    Then it will take up the full storage amount
-   If you save multiple copies of an item with subtle or small changes,
    then the new copies will take up less storage than the original item
    as we'll de-duplicate things like Meshes and Textures.

# How to reduce your storage use?

1.  Delete items in your inventory that you are not using
2.  Delete worlds that you have saved that you are not using
    -   Deleting the world orb is not enough you need to actually delete
        the world. There is a \[<https://youtu.be/S5nchVgv9to>\|
        tutorial from ProbablePrime\].

# How to identify what is taking up storage?

If you're unsure what is taking up storage on your account, then you can
follow these steps:

1.  Inside Resonite, open up the contacts tab and selecting the
    "Resonite" user. This is a bot and you can send it commands.
2.  Send it the command: `/requestRecordUsageReport`
3.  This will email you a report about what is using up the most storage
    on your account, you can use this to identify what you might need to
    clear up.

# How to avoid using storage?

-   Don't save everything you see, you can usually find it in public
    folders, or re-get it later.
-   Avoid saving large items to your worlds.
-   Avoid saving videos and pictures to your inventory or worlds. Export
    Images to your computer.
