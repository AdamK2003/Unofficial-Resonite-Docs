The ButtonValueShift component can be used to make a button add X to a
value whenever it is pressed.

## Fields

## Usage

To function, the component simply needs to be attached to a slot that
also has a button component attached to it. From then on, pressing that
button will activate the ButtonValueShift, making it shift its
`TargetValue` by its `Delta`.
