The `TipJar` component can be used to spawn in the "Send Credits"
dialogue when activated, allowing users to send `KFC` and `NCR` to each
other.

## Fields

## Usage

The TipJar component works by simply adding it to a slot. Now, if
anything on or under that slot is clicked, the "Send Credits" dialogue
will appear, prompting whoever clicked it to send the specified token to
the specified user. There is a cooldown after activating a TipJar,
preventing a user from activating it again for a short while.

If the recipient is also the user trying to send the tip, the TipJar
will open an empty "Send Credits" dialgoue.
