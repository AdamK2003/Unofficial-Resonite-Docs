The ActiveUserCloudValueVariable provides a field that is synced to a
cloud variable, with the user it is parented under being the owner of
the value.

## Fields

## Usage

To use this component, simply add it to a slot underneath a user's
hierarchy and set the `Path` to the path of a cloud variable. (make sure
that the variable and component are of the same type!) The component's
`Value` field will then be filled with the value from the cloud
variable.
