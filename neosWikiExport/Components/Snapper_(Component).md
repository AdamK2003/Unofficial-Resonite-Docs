## Intoduction

## Usage

## Behavior

Allows the slot in which this component resides in to snap to a
[SnapTarget](SnapTarget_(Component) "wikilink") in another slot. The
SnapTargetWhitelist allows you to specify a list of SnapTargets that
this component will link to in case you want to limit its snapability.
The keywords list allows you to provide a list of words which the
SnapTarget can use to filter for specific types of snappers.

It is important to have this in a slot shared with a
[Grabbable](Grabbable_(Component) "wikilink") component in the root link
of the object you wish to snap. Snapped components will become children
of the snap target.
