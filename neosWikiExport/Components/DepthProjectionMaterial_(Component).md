<languages></languages> <translate> This component is commonly used when
importing depth videos and acts as a material that displaces vertices in
3D.

## Fields

## Usage

The material uses a file that has a greyscale video (representing depth
at each pixel) and a normal color video in order to "overlay" the color
info on top of the 3D distortion created by the greyscale input. There
are texture2D slots for depth and color, meaning two separate files
could be used given the DepthTextureOffset property is set to 0.
