## Intoduction

The **AvatarObjectPermission** component is a Permissions component
which determines which avatars users are allowed to equip if the avatar
is tagged properly.

## Fields

## Usage

This permission allows or disallows specific avatars to be used. Tags
are used to determine to in-/equipability of such tagged avatars.

## Examples

Avatar-A has the Tag "AvatarA". Avatar-B has the Tag "AvatarB".

If the permission is set to `Whitelist` then only the tags which \*are\*
in the list are allowed to be equipped.

If the list contains "A" as a tag and only AvatarA has the Tag (on
avatar root) "A" and the FilterMode is set to `Whitelist`. Then only
AvatarA is allowed to be equipped.
