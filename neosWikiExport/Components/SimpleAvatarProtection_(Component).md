## Intoduction

SimpleAvatarProtection prevents other users from wearing an avatar or
saving it.

## Usage

## Behavior

When attached anywhere on an avatar, the SimpleAvatarProtection
component prevents all users, other than the single user listed on the
component, from saving the avatar, grabbing materials off of it, or
equipping it.

The component is automatically attached to an avatar if "Protect Avatar"
is checked when creating it.

All instances of SimpleAvatarProtection on an avatar can be removed *by
its owner* by clicking the "Remove All Instances" button. No other user
can remove the component. This is useful if you are trying to clear
protection from an avatar, but cannot remember where the component was;
you can simply add another instance and remove them all at once.
