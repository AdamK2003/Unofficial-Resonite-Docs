The ItemTextureThumbnailSource component can be used to customize the
inventory preview of an item, setting it to a texture.

## Fields

## Usage

To work, the component just needs to be attached to any slot in the
object's hierarchy and have an image in its `Texture`.

## Examples

This component can be used when the automatically generated preview for
an item isn't satisfying enough or you want to ensure that the preview
looks the same every time or shows the item off in a certain way.

An example of an item that uses this is the Clear Protoflux button in
the Essential Tools folder.
