## Intoduction

The **ViolentAprilFoolsExplosion** component, when deleted, causes an
explosion animation to be played on any mesh below it in the hierarchy.

This component was added as an [April Fool's
Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools%27_Day) joke on April
1st, 2019.

## Usage

## Behavior

This component causes all
[MeshRenderers](MeshRenderer_(Component) "wikilink") under it in the
hierarchy to expand outwards based on the `BloatMagnitude` while playing
the audio in `_bloatingClip`, followed by an explosion particle effect,
the playing of the audio in `_explosionClip`, and the deletion of the
slot it's attached to.
