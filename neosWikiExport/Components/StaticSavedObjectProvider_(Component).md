## Usage

\[//github.com/Resonite-Metaverse/ResonitePublic/issues/2582ã€€Answer
from Frooxius\]: Unfortunately there's not a direct way to use it right
now. The only usage is to pre-download some objects and their assets so
they load faster, but I don't think we're actively using it even
internally at this moment.

It's an old thing that has been added in the past, but I forget the
exact reason.
