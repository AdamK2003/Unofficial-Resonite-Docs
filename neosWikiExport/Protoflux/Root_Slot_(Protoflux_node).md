The **Root Slot** node outputs the world [Root](Root "wikilink")
[Slot](Slot "wikilink").

In some worlds, users may be under the management of systems which
parent a user to a slot which is other than the [Root](Root "wikilink")
Slot. This is common with Spawn Areas which have the Parent User setting
enabled or with World Management systems that create a new slot for each
user. When such systems exist it is recommended that your systems
respect them. This can be done by using [Local User Space (Protoflux
node)](Local_User_Space_(Protoflux_node) "wikilink") instead. This can
be useful for things like:

-   Guns
-   Rocket Launchers and other projectiles
-   Gadgets and Tools which re-parent items
