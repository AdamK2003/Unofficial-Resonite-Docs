The **Get Slot Active Self** node reports the Active property of the
input `Instance` slot.

## Usage

This node only checks the Active property of the input `Instance` slot.
As such, it will output True if the input `Instance` slot is set as
active even if it is currently inactive due to a parent slot being set
as inactive. If it is only required to check whether a slot is currently
active in the world, use the [Get Slot
Active](Get_Slot_Active_(Protoflux_node) "wikilink") node.
