The **Set Up** node rotates the `Instance` slot such that its positive Y
axis becomes parallel to the input
[global](Coordinate_spaces#Global_vs._Local "wikilink") `Up` direction
vector when an impulse is received at `Set`.

## Usage

An impulse is fired from `OnDone` when the `Instance` position is
successfully changed. No impulse will be fired if there is no valid
`Instance` when an impulse is received at `Set`.

## Examples
