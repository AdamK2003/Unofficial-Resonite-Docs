The **String** node outputs the string that is entered into the node.

String nodes can also be imported with specific content by giving a
regular text file the `.Protofluxstring` extension and importing it into
Resonite.

## Usage

After spawning the Node with a Protoflux tip, you can drag a wire from
it to access the String value inside of it.
