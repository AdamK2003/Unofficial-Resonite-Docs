The **Impulse Relay** node is used to make your Protoflux tidy. Instead
of the impulse connection graphically going directly from point A to
point B, you can insert impulse relays into the connection, and then
drag the relays around until the connection path looks nicer.

To insert an impulse relay in an impulse connection, simply grab using
the [Protoflux Tooltip](Protoflux_Tooltip "wikilink") on the connection
at the location you want the relay to be inserted.

## Usage

## Examples

In this image, red arrows point to the locations of impulse relays along
a long impulse connection. Without these relays, the connection would go
directly from the [If node](If_(Protoflux_node) "wikilink") on the left
to the If node on the right, obscuring some of the logic.
