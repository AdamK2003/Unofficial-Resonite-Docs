The **Display Impulse** node displays a colourful 'pulse' visual
whenever an impulse is received at `ImpulseTarget`. These can be spawned
by dragging a wire out from any impulse output and pressing the
[Secondary Action Button](Controls "wikilink").

## Usage

The node also displays for the most recent received impulse:

-   The session time at which the impulse was received
-   Who the impulse was owned by (i.e. on whose Resonite client the
    impulse chain ran)
-   The total number of impulses received by the node
-   The global index (i.e. how many impulses in total have been received
    by impulse display nodes in the current session)
