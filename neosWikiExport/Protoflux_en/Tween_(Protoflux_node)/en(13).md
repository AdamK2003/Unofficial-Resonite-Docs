The **Tween** node is used to
[interpolate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation) the value of
`Target` starting at `From`, and ending at `To` over `Duration` seconds
when an impulse is received at `Tween`.

## Usage

When an impulse is received at `Tween` a \[Tween (Component)\|Tween\]\]
component is created which [drives](Drive "wikilink") the referenced
`Target` value over the duration.

The `To` value determines the final value reached at the end of the
`Duration`.

The `From` value determines the initial value at the start of the
`Duration`.

The `Duration` input determines how long the transition from `From` to
`To` takes in seconds. Default is 1.

The `CurvePreset` determines the shape of the interpolated values.
Default is Smooth.

The `OnStarted` output fires an impulse when tweening of the `Target`
begins as a result of an impulse received at `Tween`. An impulse will
not be fired if there is no valid `Target`. This impulse continues the
impulse chain which arrived at `Tween`.

The `OnDone` output fires an impulse when tweening of the `Target` has
finished. This does not continue the impulse chain which arrived at
`Tween`.

Note that only one tween operation for the `Target` can be active at any
time. Currently target value changes work via sequential writes to the
value which may not appear smooth depending on framerates and network
latency. Similar, potentially smoother, effects can be achieved with
e.g. the various Lerp nodes under
