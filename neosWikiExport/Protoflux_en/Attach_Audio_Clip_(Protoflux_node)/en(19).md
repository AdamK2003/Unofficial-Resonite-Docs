The **Attach Audio Clip** node creates an AudioClipProvider component on
the `Target` slot and fills the component's URL field with the input
`URL`.

## Usage

If the `GetExisting` input is True this will not produce components
which are exact duplicates of existing ones currently under the slot
(i.e. the existing component's URL field is identical to the node's
`URL` input).

The newly attached StaticAudioClip component is available from the
`AttachedProvider` output for the duration of the impulse chain started
by `OnAttached`.
