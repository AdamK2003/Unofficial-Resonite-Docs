The **==** node checks whether inputs A and B are equal, outputting True
if they are equal and False if they are not equal.

## Usage

When spawned from the node browser, this node accepts float data by
default. However, this node can be overloaded to accept a wide variety
of value and reference datatypes if an appropriate wire is connected to
one of the inputs.
