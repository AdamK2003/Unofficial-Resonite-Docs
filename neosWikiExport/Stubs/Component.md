<languages/><translate> A Component is something that is attached to a
[Slot](Slot "wikilink") to add functionality. Components are behind
almost every feature in Resonite, ranging from storing data to animating
your avatar.

Components have properties. Some are used by the component to keep track
of information; others are used to configure the component. Each
component page lists all of the properties exposed in the [Scene
Inspector](Scene_Inspector "wikilink").

You can attach a component to a slot in the scene inspector by clicking
the *Attach Component* button. This will spawn a list of categories;
double-click on a category to enter it, and repeat the process until you
find the component you want.

For a list of all components, see
[:Category:Components](:Category:Components "wikilink"). There is also a
list of [Components](Components "wikilink") on another page which we are
in the process of merging with this one and the category listings.
