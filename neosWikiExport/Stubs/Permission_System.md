# What is the Permission System?

The Resonite Permissions is the forefront of what a User can use to
protect themselves in a session but allow for worlds to be set in
whichever way you as a creator deem it so. It lets you have things from
social worlds to game worlds, to even experiences.

# Permission Roles

Under the Permission System there are roles called

-   Admin -> Full Control of the Session and World
-   Builder -> Full Control of the World
-   Moderator -> Partial Control of the Session for Moderation Purposes
-   Guest -> Will generally have some powers such as a grabbing,
    interacting, or spawning in the world
-   Spectator -> A Spectator they will generally not be able to do
    anything except be there and exist

# Permission Tools

Underneath the Users Tab in the Permission Settings there is a list of
options you as an elevated User can do depending on your control of the
session. You can do things such as:

-   Kick -> Removes User from the session temporarily
-   Ban -> Bans the User from the current Session
-   Silence -> Mutes the user for everyone in the Session
-   Alter Permission -> Promoting or Demoting users depending on the
    situation
