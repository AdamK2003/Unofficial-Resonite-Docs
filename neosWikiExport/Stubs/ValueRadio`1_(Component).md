## Intoduction

ValueRadio components can be used to create a radio selector, meaning a
set of buttons that are used to set the same value to different options.

## Fields

## Usage

To function, the component simply needs to be attached to a slot that
also has a button component attached to it. From then on, pressing that
button will activate the ValueRadio, making it set its `TargetValue` to
its `OptionValue`, which then also sets its `CheckVisual` to true.
