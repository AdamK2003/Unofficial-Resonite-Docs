The **Remap** node linearly maps one numerical
[interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)) to
another interval.

## Usage

## Examples

An input interval of \[-1, 1\], an output interval of \[0, 1\], and an
input value of -0.5 would result in the output 0.25. This is because
-0.5 represents a fourth of the difference between -1 and 1 and is thus
remapped to a fourth of the difference between 0 and 1.
