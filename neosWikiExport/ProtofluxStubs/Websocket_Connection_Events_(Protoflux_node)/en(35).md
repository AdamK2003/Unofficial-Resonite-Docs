The **Websocket Connection Events** node provides impulses that indicate
if a given [Websocket Client](WebsocketClient_(Component) "wikilink")
has successfully connected, failed to connect, or was otherwise
disconnected

## Usage

After initiating a connection with the [Websocket Connect
node](Websocket_Connect_(Protoflux_node) "wikilink"), this node will
provide an impulse indicating if the connection was successful, or if it
failed.

Once a `Connected`impulse is received, other
[WebSocket](:Category:Protoflux:_WebSocket "wikilink") nodes can be used
to communicate with the endpoint, such as the [Websocket Text Message
Sender](Websocket_Text_Message_Sender_(Protoflux_node) "wikilink") and
[Websocket Text Message
Receiver](Websocket_Text_Message_Receiver_(Protoflux_node) "wikilink")

A `Disconnected` impluse indicates that the Websocket was disconnected,
or the connection was rejected by the user specified in `Client`
