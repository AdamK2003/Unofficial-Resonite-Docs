The **GET String** node makes an HTTP GET Request to a given `URL`, and
upon success returns the result as a String

## Usage

Before using this node, check if the user allows connections to this
host using the [Is Host Access Allowed
node](Is_Host_Access_Allowed_(Protoflux_node) "wikilink"). If access is
not already granted, it can be requested using the [Request Host Access
node](Request_Host_Access_(Protoflux_node) "wikilink")

**Executing a HTTP request without being granted access will result in
the request failing.**

-   `URL` is the full host path to which a HTTP GET request will be sent
-   `OnSent` indicates that the request has been sent, but has not yet
    received a response.
-   `OnResponse` indicates that the remote server has responded. Any
    text returned by the server will be available in `Content`, and
    `StatusCode` will indicate any errors the remote server encountered
    while handling this request.
-   `OnError` indicates that there was an error connecting to the remote
    server.
-   `Content` contains any string returned by the server in the response
    body.
-   `StatusCode` contains the [HTTP Status
    Code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) of
    the response. Normally, this will be 200/OK to indicate success.
