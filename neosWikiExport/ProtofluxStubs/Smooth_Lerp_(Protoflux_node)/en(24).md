The **Smooth Lerp** node smoothly interpolates from it's current value
to a specified target value at a given speed.

## Usage

When spawned, the Smooth Lerp node's default data type is `float`. This
can be overloaded to accept the `float2`, `float3`, `float4`, and
`Color` data types by plugging the desired data types into the `Target`
input.

Using a `floatQ` data type will automatically change the node into a
[Smooth Slerp](Smooth_Slerp_(Protoflux_node) "wikilink") Protoflux node,
which cannot normally be accessed inside of the Node Browser.

When spawned, whether from the node browser or through duplication, the
node's output is the value of its target.

**Common uses of this node include:**

-   Smooth translations of an object's `Position` or `Scale` over time.
-   Smooth transitions of one color to another over time.
