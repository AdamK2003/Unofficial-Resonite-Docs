The **Websocket Text Message Sender** node sends a string specified by
`Data` to the websocket endpoint specified by `Client`

## Usage

Once a connection has been initialized by a [Websocket Connect
node](Websocket_Connect_(Protoflux_node) "wikilink"), and the
`Connected` event has been received on a [Websocket Connection Events
node](Websocket_Connection_Events_(Protoflux_node) "wikilink"), this
node can be used to send strings to the target endpoint.

`OnSendStart` indicates that the `Data` string has began transmitting.

`OnSent` indicates that the `Data` string has finished transmitting
successfully.

`OnSendError` indicates that the `Data` string failed to transmit -
either the socket is no longer connected, or some other error occurred
during transmission.

If the send was successful, `SentData` contains the string that was
originally given as `Data` - this is useful in cases where `Data`'s
value has changed between the `Send` impulse, and the `OnSent` impulse.
