# All Protoflux Nodes

Below is a *almost* complete list of all the Protoflux nodes.

If you want to make your own Protoflux node or play around with it, head over to [Protoflux Node Showcase](wikiGuides/nodeRender.md). See the [main page](README.md#how-it-works) on how to run your own instance.

> [!Note]
> Because we are missing the colors of some of the nodes, the formatting can be off for some of them. We are aware of this and will fix it eventually. The plan is to put them all in a template, group them up and add a description on what it do. One page, as you might have already noticed, doesn't only make you suffer in-game. ^^'
