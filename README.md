# Unofficial Resonite Documentation

> [!NOTE]
> This project is a WIP. There are plans to automate certain parts of the wiki.

## Why

This documentation(/wiki) got created in response to the [Resonite Issue #1](https://github.com/Yellow-Dog-Man/Resonite-Issues/issues/1). Myself and a few involved in this Issue think a static site generator is the better Wiki-Solution for complex Software these days.

## Contribute

This documentation is using [Docsify.JS](https://docsify.js.org) with Markdown.
To run the Wiki locally, please follow the [Docsify.JS instructions](https://docsify.js.org/#/quickstart). You need Node.JS installed on your workstation for the instructions to work.

Start command is `docsify serve .`

## TODO

The plan right now is to make the website fit Resonites branding and get all needed Docsify.JS Plugins running. Content wise, I think it is good to start out with what NeosVR offers on their Wiki. and import it. For that [mediawiki-to-gfm](https://github.com/outofcontrol/mediawiki-to-gfm) can be used. But im unsure on how to proceed from there... Specifically, when the Offical Resonite Wiki launches.
